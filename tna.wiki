Tcl Numeric Arrays : TNA 

This is a package to do arithmetic on arrays on numbers.  It is similar to sevaral 
other packages including:

   * [narray] : [http://www.ncnr.nist.gov/staff/nickm/narray.html]
   * [NAP] : [tcl-nap.sourceforge.net]
   *

TNA is coded in C and Tcl using critcl to glue it into a loadable Tcl package.  It is a follow up to 
my experimental [Numeric arrays in pure Tcl] prototype.
