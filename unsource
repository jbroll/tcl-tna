 # unsource <file>
 #
 # unsource is a command line program to remove "source" statements by replacing them
 # with the contents of the sourced file.  The program is used to create a single file
 # that contains all the code related to a program, library or module.  Sometimes a
 # source statement is used to read in parameters or data from the runtime environment.
 # When this is the case the source statement can be annotated with "Not UnSourced" as
 # a comment on the same line and the source statement will be left in the output.
 #
