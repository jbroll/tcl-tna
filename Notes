List subsections
	a list 4:2,5:8

TEST tna::index IRAF|Python
TEST tcl variable access

Replace register list with ARec table
	Add nrec/arec allocation
	Add expansion of record array length

Allow threaded reduction
	if reduction operator used with accumulator whose dimension
	is smaller than dims.  Duplicate accumulator in each thread
	Accumulate after thread are complete.

Conversion from Tcl list value
    a set {{ 1 2 3 } { 4 5 6 } { 7 8 9 }}

ReShape
    a shape { 3 2 4 }


Broadcast checking
	strict
	tile
	any



Reverse slices
    Assignment alias detection
      see if target is present in expression
      see if sections overlap
        warn user
        copy onto target after execution to temp?

Function Calls

TNA extensions
    Add functions as opcodes

Specific indexing	a[Y+4,X] = b

Move parts of execute into compile
    Add dimensions component to compiled code 
    returning a triple (dims, regs, text).

    Add compiler epochs to track definitions of arrays
    and values and cache string to code conversion

Move threaded register allocation into threads.



#
# Index registers:
#
# There are 5 special registers used to access the current slice index.  They are
# named X, Y, Z, U, and V.  The X register may only be used with the special xxx instruction
# to copy the X index vector to a temporary.  The other index registers are scaler values and
# may be used as any other scalers are.
