#
# Index registers:
#
# There are 5 special registers used to access the current slice index.  They are
# named X, Y, Z, U, and V.  The X register may only be used with the special xxx instruction
# to copy the X index vector to a temporary.  The other index registers are scaler values and
# may be used as any other scalers are.
