Reverse slices
    Assignment alias detection

    Look at incr on values and on single item slices to see it 
    they get set to 0 somewhere.

Move parts of execute into compile
    Add dimensions component to compiled code 
    returning a triple (dims, regs, text).

    Add compiler epochs to track definitions
    of arrays and values and cache string to code


Tcl variable access.



# Tcl Numeric Array assembler
#
# Opcodes of the TNA machine are written in 3 address notation.  The assignment arrow reminds
# everyone what the argument order is.  Otherwise it is syntacic sugar.  The second argument
# to unary operators is ignored.  
#
# Arguments to opcodes must be declaried registers.  Registers may be decalired to contain
# arrays, values, constants or then can be temporaries.  The expected types of registers must
# match thier instructions.
#
#  opcode is one of the recognized operators:
#
#	set
#	add sub mul div mod neg
#	equ neq gt lt gte lte
#	and or band borr bxor shl shr
#	exp pow sin cos tan atan
#
# Index registers:
#
# There are 5 special registers used to access the current slice index.  They are
# named X, Y, Z, U, and V.  The X register may only be used with the special xxx instruction
# to copy the X index vector to a temporary.  The other index registers are scaler values and
# may be used as any other scalers are.
